"newcd" refers to the parameterization that Isaac gave me...
   it is used in my AMS conference preprint (Yablonsky et al. 2006)...

"newcd2" refers to the parameterization in Moon et al. 2006 (MWR, submitted)...
   i have not yet done any phase2 simulations with this paramterization...

according to Biju, in the 2006 GFDL model: 
   "newcd2" was implemented on the atmospheric side in "MFLUX2.F"...
   BUT "orig" was kept on the ocean side in "ocean.f", SUBROUTINE WIND...
